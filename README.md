# network-script
My Network Scrips \
This script would run with a bash environment. You would initialize the script by just running it. 
Before running, ensure you have both vlan list and Network IP list that you would be creating. Once you have those 2 files, run the script and supply the full path of the network file. If the file does not exist, the script would exit.
After you supply both files, it would copy both files to your home directory and create various files after running. 

# Usage 
```$ git clone https://github.com/bosundare/network-script.git  ``` \
```$ cd network-script ``` \
```$ chmod +x vlanfinal ``` \
```$ ./vlanfinal ```
